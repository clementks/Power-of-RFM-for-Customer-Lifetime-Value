# Power-of-RFM-for-Customer-Lifetime-Value


   RFM is a dynamic customer scoring methodology for assigning each customer a value based on historical purchase data. When required to determine customer lifetime value, RFM enables firms or brands to understand customers’ activities at a more granular, segmented level. In turn, the messaging and promotions can be tailored to the determined value in the RFM scoring methodology. In practice, we can bucket the segments into a value spectrum profiles based on variations of customer personas: VIP, Regular, and New Customer, Lost Customer, Big Spender which usually have to be aligned with the marketing programme. The gradations of customer type allow me to personalize content and messaging by bucket in a way that more closely aligns with the customer’s behavior.

Public Tableau domain is free.
